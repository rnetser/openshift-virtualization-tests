VM Template Upgrade Continuity Tests

Tests that a VirtualMachineTemplate created directly, and a VirtualMachineTemplate
captured (via a VirtualMachineTemplateRequest) from a VM created by that template, both
survive a cluster upgrade, and that those pre-existing VirtualMachineTemplate remains usable
to create new VMs after the upgrade.
