Migration Metrics on a Dual-Stream (RHCOS 9 + RHCOS 10) Cluster

STP:
https://github.com/RedHatQE/openshift-virtualization-tests-design-docs/blob/main/stps/sig-virt/dual-stream-cluster-rhcos9-rhcos10/iuo.md

Markers:
    - mixed_os_nodes
    - rwx_default_storage

Preconditions:
    - Migration bandwidth limited for the under-test VM, so migration metrics are sampled while migration
      is in progress. The Windows VM uses a much higher bandwidth cap than RHEL (its guest memory is
      considerably larger), since a plain (unthrottled) migration completes too quickly for metrics to be
      sampled mid-flight.
