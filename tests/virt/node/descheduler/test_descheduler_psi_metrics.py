Load-aware descheduler rebalancing tests.

Jira: https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/CNV-80073  # <skip-jira-utils-check>

Preconditions:
    - Descheduler operator installed and configured by autopilot
    - Multiple schedulable worker nodes available for migration
    - Set of running VMs spread across the cluster, sized to consume about half of the
      available memory per node
